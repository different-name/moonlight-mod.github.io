**moonlight** is yet another Discord client mod, focused on providing a decent user and developer experience.

moonlight is heavily inspired by hh3 (a private client mod) and the projects before it that it is inspired by, namely EndPwn. All core code is original or used with permission from their respective authors where not copyleft.

moonlight is a **_passion project_** - things may break from time to time, but we try our best to keep things working in a timely manner.

moonlight is licensed under the [GNU Lesser General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html) (`LGPL-3.0-or-later`).

## Why moonlight?

A common question we get is what moonlight does differently, and why it's worth trying. Here's a list of what we personally think is good about moonlight.
