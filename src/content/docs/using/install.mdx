There are several ways to install moonlight. It is suggested to use the installer or CLI if you are not a developer.

:::caution
moonlight (and other client mods) are against the Discord terms of service. **Client mods are a risk** - if this makes you uncomfortable, don't install them.

Despite that, we try our best to ensure your account and system is safe. There are no reported bans from using moonlight, and moonlight disables tracking and analytics to be less detectable. Discord is more focused on fighting spam and API abuse than client modders.

## moonlight installer

The moonlight [installer](https://github.com/moonlight-mod/moonlight-installer) automates the installation process for you. To use it, [download](https://github.com/moonlight-mod/moonlight-installer/releases/latest) and run the installer, download moonlight through it, and then patch a Discord installation.

Discord installations are autodetected on your machine. Keep the installer in the event that a Discord update breaks moonlight, so you can unpatch Discord or update moonlight.

  <TabItem label="Windows">
    <LinkButton href="https://github.com/moonlight-mod/moonlight-installer/releases/latest/download/moonlight-installer.exe" icon="seti:windows">Download</LinkButton>

    Download and run `moonlight-installer.exe`. Close Discord fully before patching.

  <TabItem label="macOS">
    <LinkButton href="https://github.com/moonlight-mod/moonlight-installer/releases/latest/download/moonlight-installer-macos.dmg" icon="apple">Download</LinkButton>

    Download and run `moonlight-installer-macos.dmg`.
    <Aside>
      Patching on macOS may cause issues with application signing, and moonlight currently does not persist between updates on macOS. This is planned to be fixed in the near future.

  <TabItem label="Linux">
    <LinkButton href="https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.moonlight_mod.moonlight-installer" icon="linux">Download</LinkButton>

    Install [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/), then install the moonlight installer from Flathub.

    <Aside>
      Only some methods of Discord installations are supported:

      - Local installations in `~/.local/share`
        - A script to install Discord locally (maintained by a community member) is available [here](https://gist.github.com/maddymeows/6af1a5d5a870c13b7b159c4463edee70).
        - moonlight has an auto updater for Linux in the "Native Fixes" extension.
      - Discord installed through Flatpak as a user
        - System installations are not supported.

      Discord installations from system package managers are not supported.

## moonlight-cli

A [command line installer](https://github.com/moonlight-mod/moonlight-installer/tree/main/crates/moonlight-cli) can be compiled from source manually and used to patch moonlight.

```shell
cargo install --git https://github.com/moonlight-mod/moonlight-installer.git moonlight-cli
moonlight-cli install stable # or `moonlight-cli install nightly`
moonlight-cli patch /path/to/discord/executable
```

You can specify a custom moonlight `dist` directory with `moonlight-cli patch -m /path/to/moonlight/dist`.

## Manual installations

Manual installations are suggested for those who wish to work on moonlight itself.

- [Build moonlight](/dev/setup).
- Go to your Discord install's `resources` folder.
- Rename the `app.asar` to `_app.asar`, and create an `app` folder. Discord will load the folder instead of the `.asar` now that it has been renamed.
- Create the following files in `resources/app`:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "name": "discord",
  "main": "./injector.js",
  "private": true
}
```

```js title="injector.js"
require("/path/to/moonlight/dist/injector").inject(
  require("path").join(__dirname, "../_app.asar")
);
```

Adjust the `/path/to/moonlight/dist` to point to the `dist` folder in your locally cloned moonlight install.

You should have the following structure:

<FileTree>
- resources
  - _app.asar
  - app
    - injector.js
    - package.json
</FileTree>

After first launch, moonlight will create a config directory in the Electron `appData` path named `moonlight-mod`:

- Windows: `%AppData%/moonlight-mod`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/moonlight-mod`
- Linux: `~/.config/moonlight-mod`

Each Discord branch has its own `.json` file for configuration.

## Browser

moonlight optionally runs in the browser. To use it, [build moonlight](/dev/setup), and then build the browser extension:

- Manifest v3 (Chrome): `pnpm run browser`
- Manifest v2 (Firefox): `pnpm run browser-mv2`

The output extension will be at `dist/browser`. Chrome users can check "Developer mode" and click "Load unpacked" in `chrome://extensions`, and Firefox users can click "Load Temporary Add-on" in `about:debugging`.

Browser support is experimental and may be unreliable. Developing extensions or using custom repositories is not supported with the browser extension.

## Nix

moonlight offers a [nixpkgs](https://search.nixos.org/packages?show=moonlight) package and a [flake](https://github.com/moonlight-mod/moonlight/blob/main/flake.nix), which has the option to use nightly if the `develop` branch is selected and provides declarative home-manager configuration options.

Please leave an issue on the [nixpkgs](https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs/issues) or [moonlight](https://github.com/moonlight-mod/moonlight/issues) repository depending on which one you are using in case of a build failure.

### Nixpkgs (recommended)

User-level installation:

```nix title="configuration.nix"
users.users.alice.packages = [
  (pkgs.discord.override { withMoonlight = true; })
];
```

System-wide installation:

```nix title="configuration.nix"
environment.systemPackages = [
  (pkgs.discord.override { withMoonlight = true; })
];
```

### Flake

```nix title="flake.nix"
{
  inputs.moonlight = {
    url = "github:moonlight-mod/moonlight"; # Add `/develop` to the flake URL to use nightly.
    inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
  }
}
```

:::note
It's a Nix to JSON converter. It is best to do it imperatively and then look at the `~/.config/moonlight-mod/stable,ptb,canary,development.json`
:::
```nix title="home.nix"
{ inputs, ... }:
{
  imports = [
    inputs.moonlight.homeModules.default
  ];

  programs.moonlight-mod = {
    enable = true;
    stable = {
      extensions = {
        allActivites.enabled = true;
        alwaysFocus.enabled = true;

        betterEmbedsYT = {
          enabled = true;
          config = {
            fullDescription = false;
            expandDescription = true;
          };
        };
      };
    };
  };
}
```
