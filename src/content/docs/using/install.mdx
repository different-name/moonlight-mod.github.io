There are several ways to install moonlight: through the GUI installer, the CLI installer, or manually building it yourself. If you do not plan to develop on the moonlight codebase itself, it is suggested to use the GUI installer.

## moonlight installer

The moonlight [installer](https://github.com/moonlight-mod/moonlight-installer) automates the installation process for you. To use it, [download](https://github.com/moonlight-mod/moonlight-installer/releases/latest) and run the installer, download moonlight through it, and then patch a Discord installation. Discord installations are autodetected on your machine.

Keep the installer in the event that a Discord update breaks moonlight, so you can unpatch Discord or update moonlight.

## moonlight-cli

A [command line installer](https://github.com/moonlight-mod/moonlight-installer/tree/main/crates/moonlight-cli) can be compiled from source manually and used to patch moonlight:

```shell
cargo install --git https://github.com/moonlight-mod/moonlight-installer.git moonlight-cli
moonlight-cli install stable
moonlight-cli patch /path/to/discord/executable
```

You can specify a custom moonlight `dist` directory with `moonlight-cli patch -m /path/to/moonlight/dist`.

## Manual installations

- [Build moonlight](/dev/setup).
- Go to your Discord install's `resources` folder.
- Rename the `app.asar` to `_app.asar`, and create an `app` folder. Discord will load the folder instead of the `.asar` now that it has been renamed.
- Create the following files in `resources/app`:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "name": "discord",
  "main": "./injector.js",
  "private": true
}
```

```js title="injector.js"
require("/path/to/moonlight/dist/injector").inject(
  require("path").join(__dirname, "../_app.asar")
);
```

Adjust the `/path/to/moonlight/dist` to point to the `dist` folder in your locally cloned moonlight install.

You should have the following structure:

<FileTree>
- resources
  - _app.asar
  - app
    - injector.js
    - package.json
</FileTree>

After first launch, moonlight will create a config directory in the Electron `appData` path named `moonlight-mod`. Each Discord branch has its own `.json` file for configuration.

## Browser

moonlight optionally runs in the browser. To use it, [build moonlight](/dev/setup), and then build the browser extension:

- Manifest v3 (Chrome): `pnpm run browser`
- Manifest v2 (Firefox): `pnpm run browser-mv2`

The output extension will be at `dist/browser`. Chrome users can check "Developer mode" and click "Load unpacked" in `chrome://extensions`, and Firefox users can click "Load Temporary Add-on" in `about:debugging`.

Browser support is experimental and may be unreliable. Developing extensions or using custom repositories is not supported with the browser extension.

## rocketship

Linux users can install a custom Discord build with [rocketship](https://github.com/moonlight-mod/rocketship) and then install moonlight into it. Enable the rocketship extension after installation.
