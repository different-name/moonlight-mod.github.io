## Discord server

Most conversations happen in [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/FdZBTFCP6F). Announcements are published in the `#announcements` channel, which can be forwarded to your own server if you wish.

When asking for help using moonlight, post in the `#support` channel. When asking for help writing extensions, post in the `#extension-devel` channel.

## Bluesky

moonlight also has [a Bluesky account](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:uiwhayeayjutykag74l3yits). Important notices will be published here.

:::caution
This account is not actively monitored. Do not ask for support via Bluesky.
:::

## GitHub

If you have a technical issue or feature request relating to moonlight, create an issue on the appropriate repo [in our GitHub organization](https://github.com/moonlight-mod).

:::caution
Do not create GitHub issues for extensions on the moonlight organization. Post in the moonlight Discord server instead, or go to the extension's Git repository if issues can be created.
